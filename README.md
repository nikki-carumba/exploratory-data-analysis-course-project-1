#  Exploratory Data Analysis- Course Project 1

It uses "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 

The goal of the project is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 and reconstruct the plot provided in [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

Here is the data for the project:
 <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

It is assumed that the dataset in already downloaded before running the R scripts in this repository.

## Files
This repository contains the following files:
- `README.md` provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
Scripts for the plot reconstruction
- `plot1.R` 
- `plot2.R` 
- `plot3.R` 
- `plot4.R` 
Output that corresponds to the scripts above:
